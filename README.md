# Remove-Chemical-Batteries
A factorio mod that removes the ability in vanilla game to make batteries in Chemical Plants, if you have enabled building them in Assembly Machines.

I produced this mod as a 'partner' to my 'Add Assembler Batteries' mod that enables building batteries in Assembly Machines.

This mod only works if you have my 'Add Assembler Batteries' mod enabled.

I visualise chemical plants as places where a chemical reaction is required to produce something. I also think that in the real-world, batteries are closer to being 'assembled' rather than made with a 'chemical reaction' in a plant.

# How it works
The mod only runs if the Add Assembler Bateries mod is enabled.

The battery recipe from the vanilla game is hidden so it does not appear in Chemical Plants as an option.
